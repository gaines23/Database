-- Placed each section in the order I believe everything would read off the other tables
	-- Will help determine PKs and FKs

-- TO DO:
	-- Have to rename all definitions if they are too much like InvoTech
	-- Need to focus on PAR Level logic -- Renamed EqEmpGarms (can rename later)
	-- Merge Garment Definitions
	-- Function to have equal Physical and System Inventory
	-- Scheduling Procedures
		-- Updates, Deletes, Modifications
	-- Think about how to do Garm, Emp updates (mispelled name, wrong size, etc)
	-- Size: S,M,L or 32,34,36?


-- Changes I made to DB recently:
	-- Changed up some methods for creating FKs, you will see below
	-- Changed Garm Cost to DECIMAL(3,2) from MONEY 
	-- Chnged MONEY(s) to DECIMAL (3,2) IN GarmDepreciation 
	-- Added RepairsCost for customers that charged for repairs or get charged
	-- Added new way Purchase Order will be ID'ed
	-- Added GarmDefaultValue and OrderAmount to PurchaseOrder for better tracking and cost calculations
	-- Added FK Constraints to RFID and Barcode in Inventory for all new garments that are purchased 
	-- Added EmpID, TicketNumber, GarmentNumber to GarmentDepreciation to track specific garment
		-- Added Cascade constraints to EmpID
	-- Thought that Inventory should be a whole inventory that lays out every employees garments

	-- NonTagged Inventory will hold all of the non tags that can be placed in inventory if an Emp needs a new garment
	-- Added Total for each garmentID in Purchase Order
	-- Added PAR Level on Inventory that will calculate total garms per Garm
	-- Added PAR Level on Hierarchy for total per each garm
	-- Added Sex on Hierarchy 
	-- Addded Percentage of reserve stock needed for each garment in Hierarchy
		--can change to GarmDefault if more logical
	-- Added LifeExpectancy and GarmWeight to GarmDefaultValues
	-- Added DesignatedSlots to Hierarchy -- Will need a Proc or Func to determine slots

	-- Added EmpJobGarm to track emp specific garms
	-- Added Cleaner Business info and Cleaning Acitivty

	-- Added PreTagged Table
	-- Added Accounting and Sales Tables under Accounting section
	-- Changed everything from TIMESTAMP to DATE and TIME - Timestamp doesn't always work properly
	-- Deleted "RepairTime", added Received and Completed as DATETIME
	-- Added DelinquentGarm to GarmActivity; Then placed in MissingGarm
	-- Added MissingGarm and DeletedGarm Tables
	--
